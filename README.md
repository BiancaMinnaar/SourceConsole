# SourceConsole
Bonsai

Overview
Bonsai is a set of tools that define a Software development life cycle.
By providing a base framework for software development, Bonsai manages the nitty gritty plumbing and general integration that take up at least 30% of software development time.
By supplying a standardised implementation of the Model View Controller -MVC pattern, Bonsai encourages adherence to the SOLID principles with Test Driven Development as a Focus. 

Requirements
Bonsai's main deployment vector is through the SourceConsole.
You may however decide to write a custom frontend for your templates by adding a reference to the TemplaterBonsai and then executing the appropriate repository RunSteps() functions.
